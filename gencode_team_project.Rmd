## 1. Counting the number of genes for each chromosome in GENCODE

In the ```feature_type``` column of raw ```d``` data, there are various rows containing ```gene```, which contains obviously annotations for genes. We might want to subset those rows from the data frame. 

```{r}
table(d$feature_type)
```


```{r}
d1 = filter(d, feature_type == 'gene')
table(d1$chrom)
```

We've subsetted only the ```gene``` row. Now we can count the number of genes for each chromosome in this data.
